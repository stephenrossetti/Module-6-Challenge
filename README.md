# Module-6-Challenge

## Description

Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard Challenge, or Module 6's Challenge, is to build a weather dashboard by accessing a third-party's API (OpenWeatherMap) and retrieving data from their application. This challenge is to build a 5-Day weather dasboard from scratch that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. The base URL used will be: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}.

The task will be achieved when an individual can search for city and the current and future weather conditions will be displayed for the city including: city name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The dashboard will also display past searches and save their data locally for future use. This challenge will test our ability to access and retreive third-party APIs, display the data dynamically, and create a working webpage from scratch.

## Installation

Create new repository and utilize OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data.

## Credits

Used the 5 Day Weather Forecast to retrieve weather data for cities. The base URL looked like: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}.

Used Bootstrap to format HTML and CSS.

Utilized coding help from Stack Overflow for suggested code snippets and efficiencies (using for loops for 5-day forecast)
Used AskBCS Learning Assistant for localStorage help.
Used TA for help on for loop i+8 to get each day instead of 3-hour increments.
